A cinema has contacted you as a developer and asked for a cinema ticket program to be developed. The company would like an interactive system that allows a user to select the number of tickets they wish to purchase. The company is focused upon giving discounts to 
people depending on their age, and they wish for this feature to be included as a feature during the calculation of the cost of tickets.
